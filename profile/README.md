## ✨ About Us

> "Technology is the magic of our time — we craft the spells."

**Create Quests** is a small but ambitious creative lab focused on:
- 🎮 Indie game development (2D/3D, multiplayer, sandbox, roguelike)
- 🕸️ Modern web apps & mini-apps (incl. Telegram mini apps)
- ⛓️ Blockchain integrations, NFTs, wallets, smart contracts
- 🧠 AI assistants, microtools & creative automations
- 🤖 Telegram/Discord bots, services, parsers, automations

We believe every project should feel like a journey — from idea to execution.
